Below is a example for how to use it.
Create a .sh script at $HOME directory eg, name Myscript.sh

This will create 2 file as output;
Myscript.sh.x
Myscript.sh.x.c

### We just have to rename the ".x"  file as some name.
e.g.
- mv Myscript.sh.x Myscript
### This will create a binary "Myscript", which we will give execute permission and use.
- chmod +x Myscript
- sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
- sudo cp -Rp Myscript /usr/local/bin

Now we can use it directly.
#Myscript
